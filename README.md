[![Travis-CI Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/maxconway/gsheet.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/maxconway/gsheet) [![CRAN\_Status\_Badge](http://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/gsheet)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=gsheet)

gsheet is a simple package to download Google Sheets (aka Google Docs Spreadsheets) using just the sharing link. Sheets can be downloaded as a data frame, or as plain text to parse manually.

Installation
------------

Install from CRAN with:

``` r
install.packages('gsheet')
```

Or install the latest development version from github wth:

``` r
devtools::install_github("maxconway/gsheet")
```

Getting started
---------------

Download a google sheet as a table with:

``` r
library(gsheet)
gsheet2tbl('docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1I9mJsS5QnXF2TNNntTy-HrcdHmIF9wJ8ONYvEJTXSNo')
```

Advanced
--------

### More control

If you want more control, you might want to use something like:

``` r
url <- 'docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1I9mJsS5QnXF2TNNntTy-HrcdHmIF9wJ8ONYvEJTXSNo'
a <- gsheet2text(url, format='csv')
b <- read.csv(a, stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
```

This way the table can be cleaned before parsing, and different options can be used in parsing.

### Downloading other sheets

If you want to download a sheet other than the first, you have to use the direct url, copied from the address bar, like so:

``` r
url <- 'docs.google.com/spreadsheets/1I9mJsS5QnXF2TNNntTy-HrcdHmIF9wJ8ONYvEJTXSNo#gid=850032961'
b <- gsheet2tbl(url)
```

This works because this makes the `gid`, which is the sheet identifier, available. If you have problems downloading the first sheet, this can also help too.
